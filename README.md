# GitHub Jobs API Search

A web app that allows users to search the GitHub Jobs API and filter their results to a location, description or contract type. It's built with ReactJS, styled-components and uses localstorage (and prefers-color-scheme) to include a theme switcher.

This project started as a sketch file which I then developed into a functional web app.
